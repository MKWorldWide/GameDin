## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the broader community in helping us maintain a secure platform. We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in GameDin, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to [security@gamedin.com](mailto:security@gamedin.com) with the subject line "[SECURITY] Vulnerability in GameDin".

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us understand and resolve the issue, please include the following in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any proof-of-concept code or exploit
- Your contact information (optional)

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and will keep you informed of our progress in resolving the issue.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patches for the current stable release. In most cases, we will also backport security fixes to the previous stable release.

### Security Announcements

When security vulnerabilities are discovered and addressed, we will:
1. Acknowledge the reporter (unless they wish to remain anonymous)
2. Provide details about the vulnerability and its impact
3. Release a patched version that addresses the issue
4. Update our security advisories with information about the vulnerability

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Review

All code changes are reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged into the main branch. Security-sensitive changes receive additional scrutiny.

### Dependency Management

- We regularly update our dependencies to include security patches
- We use Dependabot to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates
- All dependencies are reviewed for known vulnerabilities before being added to the project

### Security Testing

- We use automated security scanning tools as part of our CI/CD pipeline
- Regular security audits are performed on the codebase
- We conduct penetration testing before major releases

## Secure Configuration

### Environment Variables

Sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables and never committed to version control. See `.env.example` for the required environment variables.

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets or API keys to version control
- Use a secrets management service for production secrets
- Rotate credentials and API keys regularly

## Security Headers

Our web application includes the following security headers by default:

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher
- Sensitive data at rest is encrypted
- We use industry-standard encryption algorithms and key management practices

### Authentication

- We use secure, industry-standard authentication mechanisms
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a work factor of 12
- Multi-factor authentication is required for all administrative access

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow these guidelines for responsible disclosure:

1. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to correct the issue before any information about the vulnerability is made public
2. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
3. Do not modify or access data that does not belong to you
4. Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason
5. Do not use attacks on physical security, social engineering, distributed denial of service, spam, or third-party applications
