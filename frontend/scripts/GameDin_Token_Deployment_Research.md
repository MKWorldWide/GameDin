- **Benefits**: Established standard, wide marketplace support
- **Considerations**: Higher gas costs for batch operations

### Smart Contract Architecture

```solidity
// Recommended structure for GameDin Token
contract GameDinToken is ERC20, AccessControl, Pausable {
    // Gas-optimized storage packing
    struct UserData {
        uint128 balance;
        uint64 lastActivity;
        uint32 level;
        uint32 experience;
    }
    
    // Use constants for fixed values
    uint256 public constant MAX_SUPPLY = 1_000_000_000 * 10**18;
    
    // Immutable variables for deployment-time settings
    address public immutable stakingContract;
    
    // Events for off-chain data tracking
    event GameAction(address indexed user, uint256 actionType, uint256 value);
}
```

### Infrastructure Requirements

#### Essential Components
1. **Multi-signature Wallet** (Gnosis Safe)
2. **Monitoring System** (Tenderly, Defender)
