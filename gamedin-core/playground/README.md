# Crystal Kit Playground

This directory is for testing and demonstrating Crystal Kit (GDI) components in isolation.

## Purpose
- Rapidly prototype and visually test GDI components (GDITokenDisplay, AccessGate, UserAura, etc.)
- Experiment with props, address values, and tier gating
- Serve as a living style guide for GDI UI elements

## Usage
- Add demo/test pages or stories for each component
- Import components from `../components/`
- Use mock addresses or connect to a test backend
