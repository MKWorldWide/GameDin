*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

# Mode: AGENT âš¡
Current Task: Refactor entire GameDin application for AWS optimization including build optimization, AWS-specific features, performance improvements, cost efficiency, and infrastructure optimization
Understanding: 
- Current application runs on Vite with React/TypeScript

Strategic Decisions Made:
1. AWS Services: CloudFront CDN, S3 static hosting, Lambda@Edge for edge computing, CloudWatch monitoring, X-Ray tracing
2. Performance Targets: <2s page load, 99.9% uptime, Core Web Vitals optimization, Lighthouse score >90
3. Cost Optimization: Multi-region CloudFront, S3 lifecycle policies, Lambda cold start optimization
4. Geographic: Multi-region deployment with CloudFront edge locations for global performance

# Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯
Current Task: Comprehensive refactoring and fixing of GameDin application using Vite as primary build tool, addressing all lint errors, merge conflicts, broken files, and AWS optimization issues
Understanding: 
- Current state has 733 lint problems (297 errors, 436 warnings)
- Multiple files have parsing errors due to incomplete merge conflict resolution
- AWS SDK v3 dependencies are installed but Vite optimizeDeps still failing
- ESLint configuration is functional but many files need manual repair
- Need to prioritize critical errors over warnings
- Must maintain comprehensive documentation and inline comments
- Vite should be the primary build tool with optimal configuration

Questions:
1. Should I prioritize fixing critical parsing errors first (files that won't compile) or address the AWS SDK/Vite integration issues?
2. Do you want me to create a clean, minimal working version first, then gradually restore features, or attempt to fix everything in place?
3. Are there any specific features or components that are most critical to preserve during this refactoring?

Confidence: 95%
Next Steps:
- [X] Analyze and categorize all lint errors by severity (critical vs warnings)
- [X] Fix parsing errors in core type files (social.ts, auth.ts, etc.)
- [X] Resolve AWS SDK v3 integration with Vite optimizeDeps
- [X] Clean up merge conflict remnants and restore broken files
- [X] Implement comprehensive Vite configuration optimization
- [X] Update all documentation and inline comments
- [X] Test build and runtime functionality
- [ ] Address remaining 293 lint issues (222 errors, 71 warnings)
- [ ] Install missing dependencies (@tanstack/react-query, @mui/x-date-pickers)
- [ ] Fix remaining import/resolution issues
- [ ] Commit and push refactored codebase
