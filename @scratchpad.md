*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (🎯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (⚡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (🎯) → 95% confidence → Agent mode (⚡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (🎯) → Chain of thought analysis → Agent mode (⚡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

# Mode: PLAN 🎯

Current Task: Set up GitHub CI/CD through AWS Amplify Studio for GameDin application deployment
Understanding: 
- User wants to establish automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub and AWS Amplify Studio
- Current application is a React/TypeScript frontend with Vite build system
- Need to configure GitHub Actions, AWS Amplify Studio, and deployment automation
- Must ensure proper build, test, and deployment workflows
- Should include environment management, security, and monitoring

Questions:
1. Do you want to set up multiple environments (dev, staging, production) or just production deployment?
2. Should we include automated testing (unit tests, integration tests) in the CI/CD pipeline?
3. Do you want to configure custom domain and SSL certificates through Amplify?
4. Should we set up branch-based deployments (main branch to production, feature branches to preview)?
5. Do you need environment-specific configuration management (API endpoints, feature flags)?
