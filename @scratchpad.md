*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (üéØ) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (‚ö°) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí 95% confidence ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí Chain of thought analysis ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

## üìã REFACTORING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: App Component Consolidation
1. Analyze both App.jsx and App.tsx implementations
2. Create unified App.tsx with best features from both
3. Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
4. Add comprehensive error handling and loading states
5. Ensure accessibility compliance

### Phase 2: TypeScript Standardization
1. Convert all .jsx files to .tsx
2. Implement proper type definitions
3. Add interface files for all components
4. Ensure type safety across the application
5. Update build configuration

### Phase 3: Project Structure Optimization
1. Reorganize component hierarchy
2. Standardize file naming conventions
3. Implement consistent import/export patterns
4. Optimize bundle splitting
5. Update documentation structure

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Integrate Shopify components where applicable
2. Update test suites
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Add performance monitoring
5. Update deployment configuration

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

- [ ] Single, unified App.tsx component with TypeScript
- [ ] 100% TypeScript coverage across frontend
- [ ] Consistent project structure and naming conventions
- [ ] Comprehensive inline documentation
- [ ] All tests passing with >80% coverage
- [ ] Successful deployment with no console errors

2. **Data Migration:** How will we migrate existing user data to Shopify?
3. **Authentication:** How will we handle user authentication in Shopify context?
4. **Feature Parity:** Which features might need to be adapted or reimplemented?
5. **Performance:** How can we ensure optimal performance in the Shopify environment?
