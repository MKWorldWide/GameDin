*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (üéØ) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (‚ö°) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí 95% confidence ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí Chain of thought analysis ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

# Mode: PLAN üéØ
Current Task: Integrate OneDrive Script files and upgrade GameDin framework for comprehensive AWS deployment with Layer 3 blockchain integration
Understanding: 
- OneDrive Script directory contains comprehensive GameDin L3 blockchain implementation files
- Current project has AWS Amplify setup but needs integration with L3 blockchain features
- Need to merge blockchain infrastructure with existing web application
- Must upgrade framework to support both web app and blockchain deployment
- Integration includes smart contracts, deployment scripts, and technical documentation
- Current project has lint issues and needs comprehensive refactoring

Questions:
1. Should we maintain the current React/Vite frontend structure or integrate it with the L3 blockchain frontend components?
2. Do you want to deploy the blockchain components to AWS (EKS, Lambda, etc.) or keep them separate from the web app deployment?
3. Should we integrate the NovaSanctum AI features into the existing web app or deploy them as separate microservices?
4. What's the priority: fixing current lint issues first, or integrating the L3 features immediately?
5. Do you want to maintain backward compatibility with existing AWS Amplify deployment or create a new deployment strategy?

Confidence: 60% (Need clarification on integration strategy and deployment priorities)

Next Steps:
- Analyze OneDrive Script files for integration requirements
- Assess current project structure and identify integration points
- Create integration plan for L3 blockchain features
- Upgrade AWS deployment configuration for blockchain support
- Fix current lint issues and merge conflicts
- Implement comprehensive testing strategy
