## üõ† Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use the following prefix for your branches:
- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat/add-user-authentication`

### Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint** - JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **TypeScript** - Static type checking

Run these commands before committing:

```bash
# Lint the code
pnpm lint

# Format the code
pnpm format

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

Example:
```
feat(auth): add user authentication

- Add JWT authentication
- Add login/logout endpoints
- Add user model

Closes #123
```

## üß™ Testing

We use Jest for testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

## üì¶ Pull Requests

1. **Keep PRs small and focused** - Each PR should address a single issue or feature
2. **Update documentation** - If your changes affect the API or behavior, update the relevant documentation
3. **Add tests** - New features and bug fixes should include tests
4. **Run all tests** - Make sure all tests pass before submitting a PR
5. **Squash commits** - Keep a clean commit history by squashing fixup commits
6. **Reference issues** - Link to any related issues in your PR description

### PR Template
